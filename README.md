# IrisDatasetPlot_Machine_Learning

This Python code illustrates Supervised Machine Learning using the Iris Dataset in the Scikit-learn library.

The iris dataset contains 3 classes of 50 instances each; a total of 150 observations of the iris flower specifying some measurements: sepal length, sepal width, petal length 
and petal width. Each class refers to the type of iris plant. The three classes are Setosa, Versicolour and Virginica. One class is linearly separable from the other 2; the 
latter are NOT linearly separable from each other. The goal is to predict the class of the iris plant.

The Pattern Recognition will be shown with scatter plots.
